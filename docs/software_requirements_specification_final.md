# Change management plan
This is a management plan of action set out for each section of a company to respond to newly presented changes. A proper change management strategy should include specific objectives that must be reached as well as procedures that must be modified in order to bring out the change. It avoids negative outcomes in an organization. A clearly defined strategic plan helps in reducing stress. The opinions of every individual involved in the project should be given equal importance.People are very busy with their wants in this booming world. Window shopping is the perfect option for people to enjoy their shopping because going out and doing actual buying is really tough.

## How will you train people to use it?
Though it’s a challenging situation, customer satisfaction is the ultimate goal. I'll offer users plenty of opportunities to reconsider utilizing our website Therefore, we’ll clearly explain people how to make use of the website by letting them know about how user-friendly it is. we'll build a motivated, effective team that provides the customer with valuable information. We also inform customers know that website is enhanced by the unsatisfied feedbacks given by user they are facing currently. We will let the organization and the employees know that we do have some enhanced versions where all the requirements of customers are met. In order to provide customers with the training they need, communication is crucial. We provide practical training sessions on how to access and utilize our website, where we kept our realistic ideas into practice. We would provide seminar or demo sections for staff as a way to tell them change is everything done for the sake of profit for organization and satisfy the needs of users. Clients are also given paperwork that clearly explains each and every requirement on how and when to use it. We'll also offer training sessions for customers so they can get their questions answered. The staff will be provided with required support with the flow of the work and also for the developing,testing and executing the application

## How will you ensure it integrates within their ecosystem / software?
We will learn the information about the trending product so that we may develop an idea and introduce it to the market for production, which will be profitable for both of them.To improve the development of ecommerce website, a variety of software applications are used to develop databases, frontend code, and backend code. Each piece of software used to create a website is connected. Without completely altering the code, some of the changes made can make it simpler for the employee to deploy the code. By allowing users to search the primary category first, followed by subcategories, which is easier for searching a product required, we'll encourage people to use the website so they can quickly locate the things they need.Another advantage of our website is that users can access their accounts while admin makes changes to the website. Users can see how many items they've added and their total cost by viewing the details of their cart. By clicking the delete button, they can take everything they don't want out of their cart. The user can easily make a payment by deleting an item they don't need with the use of the remove button found in the cart. E-commerce websites make it simple for customers to browse for things online while lowering their risk and providing simple payment options.

## How will you ensure that it any discovered issues are resolved?
We must make sure that we achieved the objective and fulfilled all of the requirements. Testing must be done flawlessly in order to find a proper answer for the problems.Websites should be designed in accordance with all specifications and tested to ensure that they are effective and error-free for users.In particular, manual testing and load testing must be performed. For future use, we also need to test in various environments. Even testing with flawed data is necessary to ensure that no serious problems arise. we must compile a list of potential problems for future cycles. If any deployment fails, we must have a backup strategy to roll it back to the prior release
